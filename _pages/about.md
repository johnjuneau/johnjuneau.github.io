Hi, I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics, University of California San Diego. My research generally pertains to macro and spatial economics; although I am broadly interested in topics related to the causes and consequences of poverty and inequality in the United States. My work is supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. You can reach me at jjuneau@ucsd.edu.

From 2018-2021, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in the Division of Research and Statistics' Fiscal Analysis section where I assisted staff economists with constructing forecasts of government expenditures and receipts as well as estimating the effects of fiscal policies including the COVID-19 stimulus packages. Prior to my work at the Board, I received a BA in economics with minors in mathematics and poverty studies at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA.
